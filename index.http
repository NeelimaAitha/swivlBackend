    "instructions":"To prepare fish fry, start by marinating fish fillets with lemon juice or vinegar, ginger-garlic paste (if using), salt, red chili powder or paprika, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala (if using), and black pepper. Let the fish marinate for about 30 minutes to absorb the flavors. In a separate bowl, mix gram flour (besan) or all-purpose flour with rice flour or cornstarch to create a dry coating mixture. Dip each marinated fish fillet into the dry coating mixture, ensuring it is well-coated on all sides. Optionally, you can dip the coated fish fillets into beaten eggs for an extra crispy coating. Then, coat the fish fillets with breadcrumbs to add a crunchy texture. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated fish fillets into the pan and fry until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, flipping them halfway through the cooking process. Once cooked, remove the fish fillets from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve the fish fry hot with your favorite dipping sauce or accompaniments. Enjoy!",
